## TODO:
- [ ] Better UI!
- [ ] add a section "used letters" and the user can enable or disable it or u show it based on difficulty
- [ ] give the play a hint when they keep guessing wrong letters e.g. "This word has 2 vowels", "A" is in the word, etc
- [ ] add "play again" that takes u to the difficulty page
- [ ] A Twist!
- [ ] gamemodes! classic, speedrun, horror, etc ; too lazy to choose so make the default mode random
